## Research on Sentiment Time Series for Anomaly Detection

Sentiment time series is generated by sentiment scores in chronological order aggregated by texts belonging to each time slice, which is an effective tool to transform text data into time series. With the analysis of changing patterns in the sentiment time series generated by texts, the anomaly events that raised users’ sentimental changes can be noticed.
In most existing research on sentiment time series for anomaly detection, on one hand, the generated time series is not accurate enough to reflect the changing patterns in users’ sentiment. On the other hand, most of the existing methods detect anomaly points in sentiment time series in a simple way, which manually marks key time points related to real-life events based on short-term fluctuations or significant spikes. Aiming at the problems mentioned above, this thesis conducts relevant research on anomaly detection in sentiment time series. 
To solve the problem of inaccurate sentiment time series generation, the sentiment score calibration method based on deep clustering is proposed. High-dimensional representations of the texts are obtained based on the sentiment classification task. After fine-tuning and compression, the vectors are divided into different clusters by deep clustering. Then, the representative samples in each cluster are selected based on the distance measurement and form a sampling subset. Therefore, the sentiment score calibration is carried out in the method based on subset sampling. In the experiment of the Twitter dataset constructed in this paper, the sentiment calibration method was used, and the results showed that the deep clustering algorithm guaranteed a high accuracy and could obtain more stable and reliable correction results.
Finally, an anomaly detection method for sentiment time series based on a saliency map is proposed. At first, the original sentiment time series is divided based on overlapped sliding windows so that the target time points can be in the middle of the window. Then the spectral residual method is applied to each window to obtain the saliency map, which enhances the anomaly degree of the points. The anomalies are identified by performing a comparison between the saliency map and its local mean value. The anomaly detection experiment on the Twitter topic data set verifies that the method can effectively distinguish between anomalous points and non-anomaly points, and improves the accuracy of anomaly detection in sentiment time series

## Summary
This thesis mainly adopts deep clustering to obtain representative subsets and uses residual maps to make predictions on time series data. The simulation results show that the sentiment value is corrected to get the desired values based on accuracy and precision metrics. In this experimental dataset, the anomaly detection algorithm based on the residual map SR-DOUBLE reduces the ERR (7.2%,4.8%), and improves the AP (20.3,13.8) metrics compared to the conventional SR and SR-FORWARD. These results indicate our research is practical and be executed to applications.
